# TicTacToe-using-Digital-Electronics
Here I have included a logisim file with my fully functional design for Tic Tac Toe. This was a personal project to test out my skills of digital electronics and I am satisfied.     
In Logisim go to simulate and set the tick frequency to some high value like 1kHz. It just needs to be fast enough to not seem laggy or unresponsive. Then turn on ticks enable and enjoy playing the game.       
If the file does not work in logisim after downloading it then just copy paste the source code in notepad and save the file with a .circ extension at the end. It should work then.       
Have fun.
