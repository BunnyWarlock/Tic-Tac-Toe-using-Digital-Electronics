# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Digital-Electronics
Here I have included a logisim file with my fully functional design for Tic Tac Toe. This was a personal project to test out my skills of digital electronics and I am satisfied.
In Logisim go to simulate and set the tick frequency to some hugh value like 1kHz. It just needs to be fast enough to not seem laggy or unresponsive. Then turn on ticks enable and enjoy playimng the game.
